# Contributing
You are welcome to contribute to Zentrox in variouse ways.   
One of the easiest and most important ways is to open an issue if you found a bug.   
I will then try to fix the bug.

If you want to contribute by actually working on the source code, you can contact me at
wervice@proton.me. 
You could also open a pull request if you have changed something and would like to contribute it to Zentrox.
