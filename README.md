# ‚ùì Why...

## ... JavaScript?

JavaScript is a very fast and extensible language.  
It features most of the things I was looking for and doesn't stress the hardware it runs on to much.

## ... C?

Zentrox also uses C to speed up certain tasks.  
C had the libraries and features I needed to change the system.

## ... Express?

Express is very fast and small. It can be extended using libraries.  
In addition to that, it also is very fast and lightweight on the system.

You can contribute this project in many ways. I am happy about any feedback.
