## üí° Which problems does Zentrox solve?

Zentrox helps you with the administration of your home server and lab devices.
It provides you with important and helpful tools for managing your device.

## üéØ Features

- System statistics
- Package managing
- Firewall overview ([UFW](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall) at the time)
- Encrypted file store
- File sharing (FTPS at the time)
- Block device overview

_Zentrox is still being developed and features listed above are still being developed_

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

**Zentrox is not yet intended for active use, but for testing.**
Zentrox has the following requirements

- OpenSSL
- Uncomplicated Firewall
- Python 3.11+
- pacman/apt/dnf
- Cargo

Zentrox can be installed in one of the following two ways:

### Building Zentrox

At the time, Zentrox can only be installed by building it your self.

I am currently working on adding support for pre-built binaries or an easier way to install the project.

1. Download the latest tarball from the [Release](https://github.com/Wervice/zentrox/releases) page.
2. Unpack the tarball (`tar -xvf zentrox.tar.gz`)
3. Run the installer `bash install.bash`
4. Start Zentrox `cd ~/zentrox; ./zentrox`
5. Follow the Zentrox setup
6. Add Zentrox to your path: `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/zentrox`

### Post installation

While installing Zentrox, `install.bash` has done the following changes to your computer:

1. Adding a UFW rule to allow Zentrox to be accessed from outside your computer. The rule allows Port 8080 for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
2. Creating two directories in your home directory: `~/zentrox/` and `~/zentrox_data/`.
   > [!WARNING]  
   > The ~/zentrox_data/ directory also contains vault files and other sensitive information.
   > This directory and its contents should not be modified or deleted, as doing so may break Zentrox.

#### Removing Zentrox

Zentrox can be removed by reverting the changes mentioned above and by deleting the `~/zentrox_data/` and `~/zentrox/` directory.
Doing so, will also remove your Zentrox vault files.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Contributing

You can contribute to this project in several different ways.  
I am glad about pull requests, issues and feedback.
You can try Zentrox at any time, but I recommend using a pre-build release as Zentrox is actively being developed on and the latest code on GitHub may not be tested yet.
