Zentrox is in active development. Please **never** clone code from main and run the it, as the code will most likely have development setting enabled,
that will leave your device in grave danger while Zentrox is running.
In case you see warnings in your terminal while running Zentrox, stop the program and report the issue to [wervice@proton.me](mailto:wervice@proton.me) or open a new [issue](https://github.com/Wervice/zentrox/issues) on this repository.
Please instead download the latest version from the [Release](https://github.com/Wervice/zentrox/releases) page.


### Updates and support
As of Feb 2025, Zentrox does not actively get updates.
I am planning to package Zentrox using docker or native system packages in order to make updates without re-installing Zentrox possible.
